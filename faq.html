              No, please only provide what you know and what you’re comfortable
              sharing. Remember though, the more detail you can provide, the
              more information is available to our staff and to law enforcement

              Unfortunately, we do not save unfinished reports. It will take
              only a few minutes to complete but can be longer depending on how
              detailed you would like your report to be and what information you
              choose to share. Please make sure you have the information you
              need with you when you start filling out the form.

              No, you cannot attach them to the CyberTipline report you are
              making but it is important to make a note in the report that you
              do have them. We may contact you to discuss what information you
              have.
